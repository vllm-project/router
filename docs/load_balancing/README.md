# Load Balancing Policies

The vLLM Router supports multiple load balancing policies for distributing requests across backend workers. Each policy is designed for different use cases and can be configured based on your deployment requirements.

Worker URLs may be `http(s)://` or `grpc://`. Examples below use HTTP;
the policy is the same for `grpc://host:port`.

## Available Policies

| Policy | Best For | Session Affinity | Load Aware |
|--------|----------|------------------|------------|
| `round_robin` | General purpose, even distribution | No | No |
| `random` | Simple deployments | No | No |
| `consistent_hash` | Multi-turn conversations, KV cache reuse | Yes | No |
| `power_of_two` | Load-sensitive workloads | No | Yes |
| `cache_aware` | Prefix caching optimization | Yes (cache-based) | Yes |
| `kv_aware` | Tiered KV reuse and live-load scoring | No | Yes |

---

## Consistent Hash

The `consistent_hash` policy routes requests with the same session/user identifier to the same backend worker. This is essential for:

- **Multi-turn conversations**: Ensures conversation history stays on the same worker
- **KV cache reuse**: Maximizes cache hits by routing related requests together
- **Session affinity**: Maintains user-specific state on a single worker

### Configuration

```bash
# Using CLI
vllm-router --policy consistent_hash --worker-urls http://worker1:8000,http://worker2:8000

# Using Python
from vllm_router import Router
router = Router(
    policy="consistent_hash",
    worker_urls=["http://worker1:8000", "http://worker2:8000"]
)
```

### Hash Key Priority

The consistent hash policy extracts a routing key in the following priority order:

| Priority | Source | Header/Field | Example |
|----------|--------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | HTTP Header | `X-Session-ID` | `X-Session-ID: session-abc-123` |
| 2 | HTTP Header | `X-User-ID` | `X-User-ID: user-456` |
| 3 | HTTP Header | `X-Tenant-ID` | `X-Tenant-ID: tenant-xyz` |
| 4 | HTTP Header | `X-Request-ID` | `X-Request-ID: req-789` |
| 5 | HTTP Header | `X-Correlation-ID` | `X-Correlation-ID: corr-001` |
| 6 | HTTP Header | `X-Trace-ID` | `X-Trace-ID: trace-002` |
| 7 | Request Body | `session_params.session_id` | `{"session_params": {"session_id": "..."}}` |
| 8 | Request Body | `user` | `{"user": "..."}` (OpenAI format) |
| 9 | Request Body | `session_id` | `{"session_id": "..."}` (legacy) |
| 10 | Request Body | `user_id` | `{"user_id": "..."}` (legacy) |
| 11 | Fallback | Request body hash | Hash of entire request body |

### Usage Examples

#### Recommended: Using HTTP Headers

HTTP headers are the **recommended approach** for session affinity because:
- No JSON body parsing required (faster routing)
- Works with any request format
- Compatible with standard infrastructure tools (Nginx, Envoy, K8s Ingress)

```bash
# Using X-Session-ID header (recommended)
curl -X POST http://router:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "X-Session-ID: conversation-12345" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "llama-3",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'

# Using X-User-ID header for user-based routing
curl -X POST http://router:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "X-User-ID: user-67890" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "llama-3",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

#### Alternative: Using Request Body

For backward compatibility, you can also include session information in the request body:

```bash
# Using session_params.session_id in body
curl -X POST http://router:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "llama-3",
    "session_params": {"session_id": "conversation-12345"},
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'

# Using OpenAI user field
curl -X POST http://router:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "llama-3",
    "user": "user-67890",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

### Behavior

- **Consistency**: Same session ID always routes to the same worker
- **Unhealthy fallback**: If the target worker is unhealthy, falls back to the first healthy worker
- **Virtual nodes**: Uses 160 virtual nodes per worker for even distribution
- **DP-aware routing**: Supports data-parallel worker URLs (e.g., `http://worker:8000@0`)

---

## Round Robin

The `round_robin` policy distributes requests evenly across all healthy workers in sequential order.

### Configuration

```bash
vllm-router --policy round_robin --worker-urls http://worker1:8000,http://worker2:8000
```

### Behavior

- Cycles through workers: worker1 → worker2 → worker3 → worker1 → ...
- Skips unhealthy workers automatically
- Simple and predictable distribution
- No session affinity (each request may go to a different worker)

### Best For

- Stateless workloads
- Single-turn requests
- When even distribution is more important than cache locality

---

## Random

The `random` policy selects a random healthy worker for each request.

### Configuration

```bash
vllm-router --policy random --worker-urls http://worker1:8000,http://worker2:8000
```

### Behavior

- Uniform random selection among healthy workers
- No session affinity
- Statistically even distribution over many requests

### Best For

- Simple deployments
- When you want to avoid any sequential patterns
- Testing and development

---

## Power of Two Choices

The `power_of_two` policy randomly selects two workers and routes to the one with lower load. This provides good load distribution with minimal coordination overhead.

### Configuration

```bash
vllm-router --policy power_of_two --worker-urls http://worker1:8000,http://worker2:8000,http://worker3:8000
```

### Behavior

1. Randomly pick two healthy workers
2. Query their current load (pending requests)
3. Route to the worker with lower load

### Best For

- Load-sensitive workloads
- When request processing times vary significantly
- Avoiding hot spots without full load tracking overhead

### Note

Requires at least 2 workers. With only 1 worker, behaves like direct routing.

---

## Cache Aware

The `cache_aware` policy optimizes for prefix caching by maintaining an approximate radix tree of request prefixes per worker.

### Configuration

```bash
vllm-router --policy cache_aware \
  --cache-threshold 0.5 \
  --balance-abs-threshold 32 \
  --balance-rel-threshold 1.1 \
  --worker-urls http://worker1:8000,http://worker2:8000
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `cache_threshold` | 0.5 | Minimum prefix match ratio to use cache-based routing |
| `balance_abs_threshold` | 32 | Absolute load difference threshold for load balancing |
| `balance_rel_threshold` | 1.1 | Relative load ratio threshold for load balancing |
| `eviction_interval_secs` | 30 | Interval for cache eviction |
| `max_tree_size` | 10000 | Maximum nodes per radix tree |

### Behavior

1. **Balanced mode** (when load is even):
   - Find worker with highest prefix match for the request
   - If match rate > `cache_threshold`: route to that worker (cache hit)
   - Otherwise: route to worker with smallest tree (most cache capacity)

2. **Imbalanced mode** (when load is skewed):
   - Route to worker with lowest load (shortest queue)
   - Still updates the tree to maintain cache state

### Best For

- Workloads with repeated prompt prefixes (system prompts, few-shot examples)
- When prefix caching is enabled on vLLM workers
- Multi-tenant deployments with distinct prompt patterns

## KV Aware

The `kv_aware` policy scores workers using the request's reusable KV blocks and current load. It is supported in regular, co-located routing mode only; it is not supported with PD disaggregation. In PD mode, the effective prefill and decode policies must use other policies. KV placement credit requires gRPC workers because the gRPC chat route supplies token IDs to the policy. With HTTP workers, the policy degrades to load-only scoring and does not use KV event placement.

```bash
vllm-router --policy kv_aware \
  --router-temperature 0.2 \
  --kv-penalty-host 0.8 \
  --kv-penalty-external 0.6 \
  --kv-penalty-disk 0.3 \
  --worker-urls grpc://worker1:8000 grpc://worker2:8000
```

For each candidate, the scorer computes `ptoken = new_prefill_tokens + active_prefill_tokens` and projects the request count as `max(slot_manager.active_requests, Worker::load) + 1`. It multiplies `ptoken` by that projected count, so the score estimates the load after admitting this request and includes its remaining prefill work even when the worker is currently idle. Zero-cost cases, such as a request with no prefill work, are resolved by the KV-work and current-load tie-breaks.

`--router-temperature 0` selects a minimum-cost worker. A positive temperature samples among candidates by their relative costs. Device reuse has full credit; the host, external, and disk `--kv-penalty-*` flags configure transfer-credit ratios for those tiers. A higher credit means more reuse value and lower transfer cost.

KV-aware session affinity is disabled by default. Set `--kv-aware-session-affinity-ttl-secs <seconds>` to enable it and expire idle bindings after the given TTL (1–31,536,000 seconds). For example, use `--kv-aware-session-affinity-ttl-secs 1800` for a 30-minute idle TTL. Omit the option to compare the original KV-aware routing behavior without affinity.

### Quick Reference

| Scenario | Recommended Policy |
|----------|-------------------|
| Chat applications with conversation history | `consistent_hash` |
| Batch inference with no state | `round_robin` |
| Variable request complexity | `power_of_two` |
| Repeated system prompts / few-shot | `cache_aware` |
| Simple testing / development | `random` |

## PD (Prefill-Decode) Mode

In prefill-decode disaggregated mode, you can configure separate policies for prefill and decode workers:

```bash
vllm-router \
  --mode pd \
  --prefill-policy consistent_hash \
  --decode-policy round_robin \
  --prefill-workers http://prefill1:8000,http://prefill2:8000 \
  --decode-workers http://decode1:8000,http://decode2:8000
```

This allows optimizing each stage independently:
- **Prefill**: Use `consistent_hash` for cache locality
- **Decode**: Use `round_robin` or `power_of_two` for load distribution
